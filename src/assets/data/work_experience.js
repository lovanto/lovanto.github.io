    that can connect with users' One Drive, Google Drive, and Amazon S3. In addition, the system also connects 
    to the user's outlook to create a shared agenda with coworkers. This involved utilizing OpenAI's capabilities 
    for natural language processing, implementing the HNSW algorithm for efficient similarity search using vector data, 
    and leveraging Node.js for backend development. The end result is a robust Generative AI system that can
